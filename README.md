Folding Tab Bar and Tab Bar Menu

Inspired by [our project on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2003376-Tab-Bar-Animation)

## Let us know!

We’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation. 

P.S. We’re going to publish more awesomeness wrapped in code and a tutorial on how to make UI for iOS (Android) better than better. Stay tuned!
